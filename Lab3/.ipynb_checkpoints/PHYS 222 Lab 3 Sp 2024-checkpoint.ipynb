    "* **12-bit** refers to the number of voltage steps between the min value and max value (usually as seen on screen). For example, if the scope is on the 1 V/div scale, then the full range (ten dividions) is 10 V from min to max.  This 10 V full range is divided into $2^{12}$ steps. Each step is $10\\ \\textrm{V}/\\ 4096 \\approx 2.44 mV$.  However, changing to a 100 mV/div scale will make the  full range span only 1 V, so the step size decreases by 10x, and would be 0.244 mV. \n",
    "* **100 MS/s sample rate** means the scope takes at most 100 million voltage samples per second. So a 10 MHz signal would get sampled 10 times per oscillation, which does not produce a very accurate waveform. Such a coarsely sampled waveform can still be sometimes useful, but most of the time we will measure signals under 10 MHz. \n",
    "* **10 MHz bandwidth (maybe higher)** means the circuits in the M2K don't respond well above 10 MHz. It usually isn't a sharp cutoff, but a gradual decline in response. So a 2 V signal at 10 MHz may not appear to be 2 MHz, but slightly smaller.\n",
    "* **1 MOhm input impedance** is a spec we encountered in lab 1. When connecting the the 1+/1- inputs from the M2K, it acts like a 1 MOhm resistor is connected in parallel with whatever circuit is being measured."
