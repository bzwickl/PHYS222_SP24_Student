    "1. $V_\\textrm{DS}$ the voltage drop across the transistor between drain and source.\n",
    "1. $V_\\textrm{GS}$ the gate voltage with respect to the source. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The three regimes we observe are\n",
    "1. **The cutoff regime** If the gate voltage $V_\\textrm{GS}$ is too low, the current is cut off, even for a substantial voltage drop between drain and source.\n",
    "1. **The Ohmic Regime** For small $V_\\textrm{DS}$, there is a linear relationship between the voltage drop across the transistor and the current flowing through it (i.e., drain current $I_\\textrm{D}$)  \n",
    "1. **The Saturation Regime** For large $V_\\textrm{DS}$, the drain current is constant (it saturates), though current will increase with gate voltage.\n",
