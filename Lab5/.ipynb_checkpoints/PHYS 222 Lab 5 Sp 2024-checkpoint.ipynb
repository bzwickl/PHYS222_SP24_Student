    "# Lab 5 - Transfer functions of passive filters\n",
    "### PHYS 222, Spring 2024, Dr. Ben Zwickl, Dr. Ke Xu, Dr. Michael Pierce\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 4, the reactance lab, you **tediously measured the amplitude and phase of signals**. In lab 5 we will also measure how a circuit changes the amplitude and phase of a sinusoidal signal at different frequencies. This is known as the **transfer function** $H(\\omega) = V_\\textrm{out}(\\omega)/V_\\textrm{in}(\\omega)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will use the **Network Analyzer** feature of within Scopy to **easily and rapidly collect** gain and phase shift data for different RC and RLC circuits. The pair of gain and phase plots created by the network analyzer are usually called **Bode plots**. You will also be able to compare the data with the theory that was covered in lecture on Week 5-1 (with Dr. Cammarota). \n",

    "* **Measure Bode Plots (Gain) for a filter high pass filter**\n",
    "    * Calculate the theoretical gain and phase shift vs frequency\n",
    "    * Compare theory with measured Bode plot\n",
